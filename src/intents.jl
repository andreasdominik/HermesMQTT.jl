    register_intent_action(intent, action)

Add an intent to the list of intents to subscribe to.
Each function that shall be executed if Snips recognises
an intent must be registered with this function.
The framework will collect all these links, subscribe to all
needed intents and execute the respective functions.
The links need not to be unique (in both directions):
It is possible to assign several functions to one intent
(all of them will be executed), or to assign one function to
more then one intent.

The variant with only `(intent, action)` as arguments
applies the current DEVEL_NAME and MODULE as
stored in the framework.
The variants registerIntent... create topics with prefix
`hermes/intent/developer:intent`.

## Arguments:
- intent: Name of the intend (without developer name)
- developer: Name of skill developer
- in_module: current module (can be accessed with `@__MODULE__`)
- action: the function to be linked with the intent

"""
    publish_listen_trigger(mode)

Publish a stop-listen or start-listen trigger to make
the assistant stop listening to voice commands.

## Arguments:
`mode`: one of `:stop` or `:start`

## Details:
The Skill `HermesDoNotListen` must be installed in order to respond to the
trigger,otherwise the trigger will be ignored.

The trigger can be used to avoid false activation while watching TV or
listening to the radio. Just publish the trigger as part of the
"watch-TV-command".
The trigger will disable all intents, listed in the `config.ini` and
enable the `listen-again` intent only. The `listen-again` intent is
double-checking any voice activation, so that only exact matches of commands
(like "hÃ¶r wieder zu" in German or "listen again" in English)
will activate the intent.

The trigger must have the following JSON format:
    {
      "target" : "qnd/trigger/andreasdominik:HermesDoNotListen",
      "origin" : "HermesScheduler",
      "sessionId": "1234567890abcdef",

    match_device_room(skill, payload; slot_device="device", slot_room="room")

Find the device in a room by matching the slots of an intent (payload)
with the config.ini of a skill.

## Arguments:

* `skill`: skill name
* `payload`: intent payload
* `slot_device`: name of the slot for the device
* `slot_room`: name of the slot for the room

## Details

Devices are configured in the `config.ini` of a skill. The 
combination of `device` and `room` is used to match the slots
of an intent and must be unique within the skill.

A joker device may be defined to match any device, but it still needs to be 
unique - so this is only possible if there is a single device in a room
(e.g. `joker = light` makes it possible to call *turn on the light* in 
every room as long as there is only one light in the room **or** 
one of the lights is defined explicitly as type `light`).

Example:
```
joker = light

living_room:light = shelly1, lrmain.home.me
living_room:floor_lamp = shelly1, lrfloor.home.me

kitchen:ceiling_lamp = shelly1, kimain.home.me

stairs:ceiling_lamp = shelly1, stmain.home.me
stairs:wall_lamp = shelly1, stwall.home.me
```

In the exampe house, it is possible to call:
+ *turn on the light in the living room*: will turn on the *light*
+ *turn on the light in the kitchen*: will turn on the *ceiling_lamp*, beacuse it is 
  the only one.
+ *turn on the wall lamp in the stairs*: will turn on the *wall*
but it is not possible to call:
+ *turn on the light in the stairs*: because there is more than one light in the 
  stairs and no light is defined as type `light`. 

If no room is found in the slots of the intent, the site-ID of the intent
(i.e. the room in which the command is recorded) is used as room.
